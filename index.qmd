# About these Portfolio

The purpose of this platform is to showcase my professional expertise, academic background, and contributions in the field of public health, disease surveillance, and epidemiology. Through this site, I aim to share relevant projects, publications, tools, and resources that support evidence-based practices, collaboration, and knowledge exchange within the global health community.

It would be a resourceful site for my colleague in FETP PNG, the public health professionals, clinicians, students and front line health care workers in West Sepik Province and Papua New Guinea.
