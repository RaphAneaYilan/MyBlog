# MY PERSONAL BIO
I’m a dedicated public health leader currently serving as the Provincial Disease Control Program Manager and Deputy Incident Manager at the Provincial Emergency Operations Center (PEOC) in Papua New Guinea. In this role, I lead rapid response teams in routine disease surveillance, TB contact tracing, and active case finding—working at the frontline to protect and promote community health.

As a Field Epidemiologist and junior faculty member with FETP PNG, I am passionate about building capacity, mentoring future health professionals, and strengthening health systems through data-driven strategies.

With a strong interest in data analytics, I regularly use R/RStudio to analyze health trends and guide public health interventions. I bring optimism, enthusiasm, and a hands-on approach to every challenge, always seeking opportunities to improve outcomes and advance health equity.
